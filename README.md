# HelicalWiFi: A Helical Antenna for 2.4Ghz Wireless Connections

# Introduction
The main goal of the project is to establish a wireless internet connection through helical antenna, which produces a circular polarized pattern of RF radiation. A custom designed, stackable form of helical antenna was 3D printed in place of the conventional wireless antenna. 


# Components/Materials Used
- Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB
- Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 Card
- SMA Panel Mount Connector
- 14 Gauge Bare Copper Wire
- 74 Grams of PLA Pilament
- 5" Diameter Circular Tin Plate

# Design Criteria
- Antenna must be stackable in order to adjust the number of turns to match the desired gains
- Design must be affordable 3d printable; low pliament consumption and compact size
- Antenna design must be open source

# Design Process
input prelim sketches, cad screenshots, and final printed assembly

# Testing
input pictures of helical antenna connected with a wifi card and ss of jetson nano recieving wifi signal
Brief explanation of the results of testing

# Conclusion
if needed
